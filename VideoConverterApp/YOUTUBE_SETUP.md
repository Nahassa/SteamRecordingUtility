# YouTube Upload Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up YouTube upload functionality in the Steam Recording Video Converter.

## Prerequisites

- Google Account
- Access to Google Cloud Console
- VideoConverterApp installed

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Video Converter")
4. Click "Create"

## Step 2: Enable YouTube Data API v3

1. In your project, go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
2. Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"

## Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - User Type: External
   - App name: "Video Converter" (or your choice)
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact: Your email
   - Click "Save and Continue"
   - Scopes: Skip this step (click "Save and Continue")
   - Test users: Add your Google account email
   - Click "Save and Continue"
4. Back to "Create OAuth client ID":
   - Application type: "Desktop app"
   - Name: "Video Converter Desktop"
   - Click "Create"
5. Download the JSON file (click the download button)

## Step 4: Install the Credentials File

1. Rename the downloaded JSON file to exactly: `youtube_credentials.json`
2. Place it in the same folder as `VideoConverterApp.exe`

Example location:
```
C:\MyApp\
├── VideoConverterApp.exe
├── youtube_credentials.json  ← Place here
└── settings.json
```

## Step 5: Authenticate in the App

1. Launch VideoConverterApp.exe
2. Check "Upload converted videos to YouTube"
3. Click "Authenticate with YouTube"
4. Your browser will open asking you to sign in with Google
5. Select your Google account
6. You'll see a warning "Google hasn't verified this app" (this is normal for personal projects):
   - Click "Advanced"
   - Click "Go to [Your App Name] (unsafe)"
7. Grant the requested permissions (YouTube upload access)
8. You'll see "Authentication successful!" in the app

## Step 6: Configure Upload Settings

### Title Template

Use placeholders to automatically generate video titles:
- `{filename}` - File name without extension
- `{filename_ext}` - File name with extension
- `{date}` - Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `{time}` - Current time (HH:mm:ss)
- `{datetime}` - Full datetime
- `{year}`, `{month}`, `{day}` - Individual date components

Examples:
- `{filename}` → "2025-11-16 d2 retake 3k"
- `CS2 Gameplay - {filename}` → "CS2 Gameplay - 2025-11-16 d2 retake 3k"
- `{date} - {filename}` → "2025-11-16 - 2025-11-16 d2 retake 3k"

### Description Template

Same placeholders as title. Supports multi-line text.

Example:
```
Gameplay recorded on {date}

Original file: {filename_ext}
Converted with Steam Recording Video Converter
```

### Tags

Comma-separated keywords for YouTube search/discovery.

Examples:
- `gaming,gameplay,cs2,counter-strike`
- `highlights,frag,movie`

### Privacy Status

- **private** - Only you can see it (default, recommended for testing)
- **unlisted** - Anyone with the link can see it
- **public** - Everyone can find and watch it

### Category

Select the YouTube category that best fits your content:
- Gaming (20) - For game recordings
- Entertainment (24)
- People & Blogs (22)
- Music (10)
- Science & Technology (28)

## Troubleshooting

### "YouTube API credentials file not found"
- Make sure `youtube_credentials.json` is in the same folder as the .exe
- Check the filename is exactly `youtube_credentials.json` (case-sensitive)

### "Google hasn't verified this app"
- This is normal for personal projects
- Click "Advanced" → "Go to [App Name] (unsafe)"
- This only happens during initial setup

### "Access Not Configured"
- Make sure you enabled "YouTube Data API v3" in Google Cloud Console
- Wait a few minutes after enabling the API

### "Quota Exceeded"
- Free tier allows 10,000 quota units per day
- Each video upload costs ~1600 units (about 6 videos per day)
- Quota resets at midnight Pacific Time
- To increase: Apply for quota increase in Google Cloud Console

### "Upload Failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify YouTube channel is properly set up
- Check video file isn't corrupted
- Review quota limits

## Quota Management

YouTube Data API has daily quotas:
- **Free tier**: 10,000 units/day
- **Video upload**: ~1600 units per video
- **Maximum uploads/day**: ~6 videos

To check your quota usage:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Dashboard"
3. Click "YouTube Data API v3"
4. View "Quotas" tab

## Security Notes

- Keep `youtube_credentials.json` private (don't share it)
- The app stores authentication tokens in `youtube_token.json`
- Both files are gitignored by default
- You can revoke access anytime in [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

## Template Examples

### For Gaming Highlights
```
Title: {filename} - Highlight Reel
Description: Epic gaming moment from {date}

Tags: gaming,highlights,gameplay
Privacy: unlisted
```

### For Tutorial Videos
```
Title: How to: {filename}
Description: Tutorial video created on {datetime}

Step-by-step guide for {filename}
